# DOCHAL (determination of crop height and lodging)

This is an R script that can be used to derive crop heights and lodging areas from point clouds or digital elevation models.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Required input datasets are:
* terrain height information (as point cloud (.laz) or DTM (.tif))
* crop surface information (as point cloud ((.laz) or DSM (.tif))
* Shapefile with plot boundaries
* (optional) Shapefile with region of interest   

The output generated by this script is:
* a table (.xlsx) with crop height statistics and lodging percentages per plot
* the input plot boundary Shapefile with added plot attributes (crop heights and lodging percentages)
* a crop height model (.tif) of the plot areas
* a raster (.tif) with a lodging/no-ldging classification of the plot areas
&nbsp;    

&nbsp;  
Several processing parameters can be set by the user:
* type of input datasets (point cloud or raster)
* desired resolution of generated DTM and DSM (if input datasets are point clouds)
* export of generated raster datasets
* buffer width of plot boundaries 
&nbsp;  

&nbsp;  
The meaning of the columns in the output table is as follows (height values in meters):

| Column        | Meaning           | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| ID            | plot ID        | 
| Parzelle      | plot index    |  
| mean_height   | mean height      |   
| median_height | median height |
| SD_height     | standard deviation of heights |
| MAD_height    | median absolute deviation of heights |
| percentile.90. | 90th percentile of height |
| most_likely_lodging_% | percentage of plot area that is most likely lodging |
| probably_lodging_% | percentage of plot area that is probably lodging |
| probably_not_lodging_% | percentage of plot area that is probably not lodging |
| most_likely_not_lodging_% | percentage of plot area that is most likely not lodging |
| threshold | height threshold between lodging and not-lodging classes|
| lower | height threshold between the classes "most likely lodging" and "probably lodging"|
| upper | height threshold between the classes "probably not lodging" and "most likely not lodging"|
| min_angle | minimum lodging angle that leads to classification as lodging|
&nbsp;  

&nbsp;  

The lodging/no-lodging classes are represented by the following values in the output classification raster:

| Class        | Raster value           | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| most likely lodging | 1        | 
| probably lodging | 2    |  
| probably not lodging | 3      |   
| most likely not lodging | 4 |
